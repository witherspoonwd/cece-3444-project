# Employee Scheduling Program

Developed for my junior year software engineering class, this project aims
to be a simple implementation of a scheduling program for a workplace. It
includes a visual schedule editor, employee address book, announcement system,
and an automatic shift trade / time off request system. It also includes
an implementation for a schedule generator that takes into account
the availability of all employees.

For this project, I was responsible for implementing the homepage, calendar,
availability panel, schedule generator, and setting up the MySQL database schema.
The screenshots included above are the sections I developed.
